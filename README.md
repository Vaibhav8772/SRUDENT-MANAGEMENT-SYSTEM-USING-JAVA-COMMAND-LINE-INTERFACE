Technologies Used: Java, Hibernate, JDBC, Servlets, PL/SQL
Interface: Command Line Interface (CLI)

Overview:
Developed a robust and fully scalable Student Management System that operates through a Command Line Interface. This application manages student records efficiently, offering core functionalities such as registration, data retrieval, updates, and deletion. The system was thoroughly tested to ensure performance, reliability, and scalability.

Key Features:

CRUD Operations: Seamlessly performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on student data.

Hibernate Integration: Used Hibernate ORM for efficient database mapping and to reduce boilerplate JDBC code.

JDBC & PL/SQL: Leveraged JDBC for low-level database connectivity and PL/SQL for stored procedures, enhancing performance and maintainability.

Servlets: Enabled server-side processing and logical flow of the application.

Modular Design: Easily extensible for future features like GUI migration or REST API integration.

Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle increasing data volumes with ease.

Testing:

Conducted rigorous functional and performance testing.

Validated all modules under various input conditions and ensured database integrity.
